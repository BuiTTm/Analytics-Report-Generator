Working with the NHL API to see what I can predict with the data.

See Documentation on this here. [Stats Api Docs](https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi/-/blob/master/stats-api.md#configurations)

explore data in Ipython

### Notes

- Use tableau for a custom rink visualization?

### Potential Questions?

- Can I predict who will win a playoff series?
- Which players are undervalued?  <-- I like this one.
- Who is going to win the cup?
- What will be the score of the game?
- Where are specific players scoring from?
- Where are goalies getting scored on?
- What makes a Stanley Cup winning team different from other teams?
- Predict attendance in an Arena?
