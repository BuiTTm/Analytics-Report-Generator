# Sports Analytics

Working with the NHL API to see what I can predict with the data.

See Documentation on this here. [Stats Api Docs](https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi/-/blob/master/stats-api.md#configurations)

## Ex ID's

Hoglander - 8481535
Canucks - 23

### Grequests over Requests (API Requests)

Given that the NHL_API server does not have any limitations, we can leverage the power of asynchronous requests and get information much faster. 

Asynchronous requests basically create requests at the same time to reduce the time we are spending waiting for responses.
